<h3>How it works</h3>
  <div>Here’s what you need to know before getting started with the navbar:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Navbars require a wrapping <code>.navbar</code> with <code>.navbar-expand</code> for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.</li>
    <li>Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Use optional containers to limit their horizontal width.</li>
    <li>Use our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.</li>
    <li>Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.</li>
  </ul>
